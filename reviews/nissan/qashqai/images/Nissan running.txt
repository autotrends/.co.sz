## Nissan Qashqai: Keeping Ownership Costs in Check

One of the key strengths of the Nissan Qashqai is its affordability to run, making it a budget-friendly choice for everyday driving. Let's delve deeper into how the Qashqai keeps ownership costs in check.

**Fuel Efficiency:**  The base model Qashqai delivers a respectable combined fuel economy of around 35 mpg (56 kilometers per liter). This translates to significant savings at the pump, especially for those who drive frequently.  For even greater efficiency, consider the e-Power hybrid model, which boasts an impressive 45 mpg (72 kilometers per liter). This hybrid option offers the perfect blend of power and fuel economy, making it ideal for those seeking to minimize fuel costs without compromising on performance.

**Manageable Maintenance:** Nissan has a well-deserved reputation for building reliable vehicles, and the Qashqai is no exception. This translates to predictable maintenance costs.  While routine maintenance is still essential for keeping your Qashqai running smoothly for years to come, you can expect servicing costs to be on par with other vehicles in the compact SUV class.  Following the manufacturer's recommended maintenance schedule is crucial for maximizing fuel efficiency, minimizing the risk of unexpected repairs, and ultimately extending the lifespan of your vehicle.
