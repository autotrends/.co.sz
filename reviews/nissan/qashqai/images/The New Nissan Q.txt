Verdict

 What AutoTrends Thinks

Yes, the new Nissan Qashqai is a good car. It offers a comfortable ride, a stylish interior, and a good selection of features. While it's not the most exciting to drive, it excels in practicality for everyday driving and family life. 

How Does it Hold Up Against the Competition?

The Qashqai faces stiff competition from rivals like the Kia Sportage and the Skoda Karoq. While it may not be the most spacious or feature-rich option, it offers a good balance of practicality, comfort, and value. 

Running Costs

How is it Like Living With It?

The Qashqai is an affordable option to run.

Fuel Economy or Efficiency: The base model offers a combined fuel economy of around 35 mpg (56 kilometers per liter), which is decent for a compact SUV. The e-Power hybrid model boasts even better figures, reaching up to 45 mpg (72 kilometers per liter).
Maintenance Cost: Nissan generally has a good reputation for reliability, and maintenance costs are expected to be average for the class.

Interior and Comfort

How is the Interior?

The Qashqai's interior has undergone a significant upgrade for 2024. It features higher-quality materials and a more modern design. The cabin is comfortable and spacious enough for five adults.

How Much Interior Space, How Can it be Fitted?

The Qashqai offers a good amount of passenger space for its size. The rear seats are comfortable for adults on shorter journeys, and there's enough headroom and legroom for most people. However, taller passengers might find the rear legroom a little tight on long trips. 

In terms of settings, the driver's seat offers good adjustability for most people. The infotainment system can be a little slow to respond, but it's generally user-friendly. Cargo space is decent at 430 liters (15.2 cubic feet) with the seats up, and expands to a maximum of 1,593 liters (56.3 cubic feet) with the seats folded down.

Practicality and Boot Space

 Practicality

The Qashqai is a practical choice for families and those with active lifestyles. It offers a comfortable ride, good fuel economy, and plenty of cargo space. The visibility is excellent, making maneuvering in tight spaces a breeze. Additionally, the numerous safety features provide peace of mind for everyday driving.

 Boot Space

As mentioned earlier, the Qashqai offers a decent 430 liters (15.2 cubic feet) of boot space with the seats up, which is enough for most everyday needs. Folding the rear seats expands the cargo capacity to a maximum of 1,593 liters (56.3 cubic feet), perfect for larger loads or occasional camping trips. 

Reliability and Safety

 Reliability

Nissan has a good reputation for reliability, and the Qashqai is expected to be no exception. While there isn't enough long-term data available yet for the 2024 model, previous versions have proven reliable.

Safety

The Qashqai comes equipped with a comprehensive suite of safety features, including automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, and blind-spot monitoring. These features help to keep you and your passengers safe on the road.
